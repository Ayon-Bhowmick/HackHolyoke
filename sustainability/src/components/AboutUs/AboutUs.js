                  I'm a second year student studying Computer Science and Japanese. In addition to my studies, I work as a costume shop assistant for the theatre and as a peer writing tutor. This is my first hackathon, and I'm having a great time! My instagram is @josh__tripoliii. And, you can now also find me on LinkedIn at www.linkedin.com/in/josh-tripoli  ٩(^ᴗ^)۶

                      I am a sophmore at Lehigh University studying computer science and graphic design. I am interested in working in game development someday. In my free time I enjoy painting and doing arts and crafts. This is my first hackathon and the experience has been lots of fun :)
